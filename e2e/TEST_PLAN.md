## Running Tests

```bash
# All E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Core web app only
bunx playwright test e2e/core/

# Extension only (requires built extension)
bunx playwright test e2e/extension/

# Integration only
bunx playwright test e2e/integration/

# Interactive UI mode
bunx playwright test --ui

# Specific file
bunx playwright test e2e/core/search.spec.ts
```

## Blocking Dependencies

| Test Group | Blocked On |
|-----------|-----------|
| Core (all except smoke) | Core webpack build completing without errors |
| Extension | Extension build + Playwright Chrome extension fixture |
| Integration | Both core + extension builds, plus protocol handshake |

## Coverage Goals

- **Phase 1**: All P0 scenarios passing for core web app
- **Phase 2**: Extension loading + basic autofill
- **Phase 3**: Full integration suite
