Password autofill for NeoKeeWeb — a modern, open-source KeePass web client. End-to-end encrypted. No cloud. No tracking.

## Description (16,000 chars max)

NeoKeeWeb Connect is the companion browser extension for NeoKeeWeb, a modern open-source KeePass-compatible password manager that runs entirely in your browser.

🔑 SMART AUTOFILL
• One-click credential fill — click the toolbar button or press Ctrl+Shift+U
• Detects username and password fields automatically
• Works with multi-step login forms and iframes
• Right-click context menu for granular control (insert username only, password only, or both)

🔐 ONE-TIME PASSWORDS (TOTP/OTP)
• Insert 2FA codes directly from your KeePass database
• No need to switch apps or type codes manually

🛡️ END-TO-END ENCRYPTED
• All communication between the extension and NeoKeeWeb is encrypted with NaCl (Curve25519 + XSalsa20 + Poly1305)
• Credentials are never stored by the extension — held in memory only during the fill operation
• No analytics, no telemetry, no data collection whatsoever

⌨️ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
• Ctrl+Shift+U — Smart autofill (detects what's needed)
• Fully customizable via chrome://extensions/shortcuts
• 9 distinct commands: insert/submit username, password, both, OTP, and custom fields

🌐 WEB-BASED — NO DESKTOP APP REQUIRED
• Connects to a NeoKeeWeb tab in your browser — no native app installation needed
• Works with the official hosted version or your own self-hosted instance
• Configure your NeoKeeWeb URL in the extension settings

🗣️ MULTILINGUAL
• Available in 11 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Polish, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)

📖 OPEN SOURCE
• MIT licensed — fully auditable source code
• Built with TypeScript, Preact, and TweetNaCl

HOW IT WORKS

## Single Purpose Description (required by Chrome Web Store)

This extension autofills passwords from a NeoKeeWeb (KeePass-compatible) password manager into web page login forms.

## Permission Justifications (required by Chrome Web Store review)

### activeTab
Used to identify the currently active tab so the extension can inject credentials into the focused page's form fields.

### tabs
Used to find an open NeoKeeWeb tab for communication and to query tab URLs for credential matching.

### contextMenus
Used to show a right-click context menu with autofill options (insert username, password, OTP, etc.) on input fields.

### storage
Used to persist the user's preferred NeoKeeWeb instance URL (a single string value) in local storage.

### webNavigation
Used to enumerate frames (iframes) within a page so autofill works on login forms embedded in iframes.

### scripting
Used to inject the content script that performs form detection and credential filling into the active tab.

### host_permissions: <all_urls>
The extension must run on any website where the user wants to autofill credentials. Login forms exist on arbitrary domains, so the extension cannot pre-declare a fixed set of URLs.
